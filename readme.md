# Welcome to Insider Threat Detection World

Insider threats are among the most challenging cybersecurity risks, where individuals within an organizationâ€”such as employees, contractors, or partnersâ€”intentionally or unintentionally compromise sensitive information. These threats can manifest as data leaks through emails, unauthorized access to confidential files, or even sabotage of critical systems.

## About the Project

I have provided a full-fledged AI model for detecting insiders based on their system logs, email communications, web browsing, and more.

- The model is trained on the **CERT dataset (version 4.2)**, which can be found at: [CERT Dataset v4.2](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247/1)
- After extensive preprocessing and feature extraction, the data is fed into an **LSTM-Autoencoder**, which predicts risk scores.
- The **`model`** folder contains the trained model.
- Other folders contain datasets and related files as named.
